In part two of this security audit, I communicate the security audit results and recommendations to stakeholders. I'm including this completed stakeholder memorandum in my portfolio to demonstrate my ability to communicate in a way that supports stakeholder understanding of complex concepts.

## Scenario:

Botium Toys’ IT manager asked you to conduct an internal audit of the company’s assets, controls, and adherence to compliance regulations and standards. Then, based on the company’s current goals and level of risk, she requested that you complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist to identify and explain ways that the company can improve its security posture. 

Your task is to clearly and concisely communicate your findings and recommendations to the IT manager and other stakeholders, so they can implement the necessary controls and create appropriate documentation, processes, and procedures to ensure business continuity, the safety of critical assets, and compliance.
